<h2>Waukesha Condominium Consortium</h2>

<p>
This information is brought to you by the Waukesha Condominium Consortium.
The Consortium is a number of condominium associations who have banded
together for the betterment of its members in terms of a relationship with
the City of Waukesha, and for leverage from the sharing of mutual practices.

<div class="disclaimer">
<p>
The Waukesha Condominium Consortium is not a legal entity, and is in no way
offering legal advise. Prospective owners should thoroughly review the
governing documents of the Association of interest, and consult with their
realtor or an attorney before making a purchase decision.

<h2>What Is Different About Condominium Developments?</h2>

<p>
Choosing a condominium lifestyle can be a rewarding experience with the
right understanding of the differences between it and a single-family
dwelling. Single-family developments usually follow city-defined
requirements such as city street dimensions, sidewalks on both sides of
the street, setback requirements, etc.
</p>

<p>
Condominium developments tend to follow what are called Planned Unit
Developments, or PUD’s. To achieve maximum density for a condominium
development, a PUD allows for a private road which does not have to have
the same dimensions as a city street, does not require sidewalks, and it
has different setback requirements.
</p>

<p>
The city requires that a developer submit a PUD to the city for approval.
The PUD includes building plans, along with the Association By Laws and
structure that dictate how the Association will be handled, first by the
developer and then by the owners upon transfer.
</p>

<p>
The city of Waukesha requires a city street to provide a number of services
including trash and recyclable pickup, snow plowing, leaf pickup,
appliance pickup, spring cleanup, etc. Therefore, PUD developments
typically do not receive such services from the city.
</p>

<p>
A condominium development is typically uniform in building appearance, and
an owner owns from the “walls in” in terms of responsibility. The building
exterior, grounds, streets, etc. are considered “limited common elements”
and are collectively owned by all the unit owners.
</p>

</section>

<section id="association">
<h2>Why Do Condominiums Have an Association?</h2>

<p>
Condominium developments typically have some form of owner association that
may or may not be an incorporated entity. The Association is usually
started by the developer and controlled by them until a certain percentage
of the units have been sold. The association then becomes the
responsibility of the owners.
</p>

<h2>What Is the Purpose of an Association?</h2>

<p>
A condominium association is the governing body of the condominium
development. It usually consists of a board of directors and officers if
self-managed. The directors and officers are responsible for managing both
the long-term and day-to-day operations of the association.
</p>

</section>

<section id="responsibilities">
<h2>What Are the Responsibilities of the Association Directors?</h2>

<p>
If the condominium development was developed under a PUD, the city does not
provide certain services to the Association. Therefore, the Association is
responsible for selecting contractors to provide those services. The
Association board of directors is responsible for identifying contractors,
negotiating contracts, and managing those services.
</p>

<p>
Associations may be “self-managed,” or they may employ a property
management company to manage the day-to-day affairs of the Association.
</p>

<p>
Since owners do not individually own anything other than from the “walls
in,” the owners “collectively” own building exteriors, roads and grounds.
Therefore, the Association is responsible for all these “limited common
elements.” The Association is responsible as well for the upkeep of
exteriors and grounds, including snow removal, lawn care, building
maintenance, etc.
</p>

<p>
As the governing body of the Association, the board of directors and
officers may set certain rules and regulations for the property, including
plantings, sign limitations, etc.
</p>

</section>

<section id="fees">
<h2>How Does the Association Pay for Services?</h2>

<p>
Because the buildings and grounds are “collectively” owned by all the
owners, condominium associations usually set a management fee that is most
often collected monthly that forms the basis of the funding to maintain the
common elements of the association, including trash/recyclables pickup,
snow removal, lawn care, and building maintenance.
</p>

<p>
Part of the monthly fee is also typically put into a “Reserve” fund that is
used for major expenses such as roofs, roadways, etc. Associations may from
time to time need do special assessments of owners for unscheduled or large
expenditures that exceed available reserve funds.
</p>

</section>

<section id="owners">
<h2>What Are the Implications for an Owner?</h2>

<p>
Because the association is collectively responsible for everything but the
“walls in,” the owner is only personally responsible for the interior of
their unit. Most condominium developments are required to carry liability
insurance for everything except the “walls in.”
</p>

<p>
Owners are expected to carry what is call HO6 policies, covering their
personal effects and any unit modifications.
</p>

<p>
Since owners collectively own the building exteriors and grounds, there is
less leeway in what owners are allowed to do with these areas, governed by
the Association's rules and regulations. Understanding this will avoid
future issues with condominium living.
</p>

<h2>How Do Condominiums Differ from Single Family Homes?</h2>

<p>
A single-family home is all-inclusive of the lot and structure placed on it.
A single-family development may include certain developer restrictions,
such as the style of house, façade materials, and limitations on other
structures and vehicle type restrictions.
</p>

<p>
The owner is responsible for all upkeep and maintenance, including lawns,
shrubs, trees, and buildings.
